DESCRIPTION : 
This is a simple real-time collaborative text editor built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows multiple users to edit the same text simultaneously, with changes reflected instantly across all connected clients. The server uses WebSockets to broadcast updates, while the frontend is a basic HTML page served from the public folder. All data is stored in memory, making it lightweight and easy to run locally. Ideal for learning how real-time communication works in web applications.
